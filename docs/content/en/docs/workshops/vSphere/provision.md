The first thing we need to do is provision a cluster.
Here is the getting started guide for provisioning.

For this workshop we will use the following cluster configuration.

```yaml
add the configuration here:
  - and here
  - there
enable gitops: true
```

{{< content "../../getting-started/production-environment/_index.md" >}}

The next step will be to set up kube-vip to add a floating IP address.
